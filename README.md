## Overview

This repository is the `mjlab-native port` of [InstinctLab](https://github.com/project-instinct/InstinctLab), serving as the environment side of [Project-Instinct](https://project-instinct.github.io/).

We aim to industrialize Reinforcement Learning for humanoid whole-body control, with task families implemented on top of `mjlab` and integrated into the Project-Instinct training workflow.

**Key Features:**

- `Standalone package` Work outside the core `mjlab` repository while keeping task development self-contained.
- `Task suite` Provide locomotion, shadowing, perceptive, and parkour task families for humanoid control on `mjlab`.
- `Unified ecosystem` Integrate directly with [instinct_rl](https://github.com/project-instinct/instinct_rl) for train / play / export workflows.
- `Structured outputs` Keep experiment logs under `logs/instinct_rl/<experiment_name>/<timestamp_run>/` to match the Project-Instinct workflow.

**Keywords:** mjlab, mujoco-warp, instinct_rl, humanoid

This codebase is under [CC BY-NC 4.0 license](LICENSE). You may not use the material for commercial purposes, for example to advertise commercial products or redistribute the code as part of a commercial offering.

## Attention

Do not directly use checkpoints trained outside `InstinctMJ` with `InstinctMJ`.

- `InstinctMJ` loads the robot from XML / MJCF, and the resulting joint order is not the same as the joint order used in IsaacLab.
- Policy inputs / outputs tied to joint ordering are therefore not directly checkpoint-compatible across different simulator setups.
- Please release and use weights trained in `InstinctMJ` for `InstinctMJ` tasks.

## Installation

- Recommended Python range: `3.10` to `3.13` (`requires-python = ">=3.10,<3.14"`).
- Stable top-level runtime matrix currently locked by `pyproject.toml` / `uv.lock`:
  - `mjlab==1.3.0`
  - `mujoco==3.7.0`
  - `mujoco-warp==3.7.0.1`
- Current non-release exceptions in the resolved environment:
  - `instinct_rl` is still sourced from Git, currently locked to commit `3a2844890387eda6d93a4465cdef9e767aba8546`.
  - Upstream `mujoco-warp==3.7.0.1` currently pulls `warp-lang==1.13.0.dev20260225` as a transitive dependency.
- This means `InstinctMJ` no longer pins nightly `mjlab` / `mujoco` artifacts, but the full dependency graph is not yet “all release tags only”.

### Stable install with `uv` (recommended)

Use this path if you want the environment that matches the checked-in lock file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/project-instinct/InstinctMJ.git
cd InstinctMJ
uv sync
```

This installs the locked release stack from `pyproject.toml` / `uv.lock` and does not require a local `mjlab` checkout.

### Editable multi-repo workspace (optional)

Use this path only if you want to develop against local sibling checkouts of `mjlab` and `instinct_rl`.

```bash
mkdir -p <workspace_dir>
cd <workspace_dir>

# Option 1: HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab.git
git clone https://github.com/project-instinct/instinct_rl.git
git clone https://github.com/project-instinct/InstinctMJ.git
cd mjlab
git checkout v1.3.0
cd ../InstinctMJ
uv sync
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python --no-deps -e ../mjlab -e ../instinct_rl

# Option 2: SSH
# git clone git@github.com:mujocolab/mjlab.git
# git clone git@github.com:project-instinct/instinct_rl.git
# git clone git@github.com:project-instinct/InstinctMJ.git
```

If you skip the final editable reinstall, `uv` will keep using the version-pinned sources recorded in `pyproject.toml` / `uv.lock`.

### `pip` alternative

If you prefer `pip`, keep the same top-level pins explicitly:

```bash
pip install "mujoco>=3.7.0,<3.8" "mjlab==1.3.0"
pip install -e "git+https://github.com/project-instinct/instinct_rl.git@3a2844890387eda6d93a4465cdef9e767aba8546#egg=instinct_rl"
pip install -e .
```

- After installation, you can run the training workflow directly with `instinct_rl`-style commands:

  ```bash
  instinct-train Instinct-Locomotion-Flat-G1-v0
  instinct-play Instinct-Locomotion-Flat-G1-Play-v0 --load-run <run_name>
  ```

## Set up IDE (Optional)

If VSCode / Pylance misses local imports in a multi-repository workspace, add these paths to `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
    "<workspace_dir>/InstinctMJ/src",
    "<workspace_dir>/mjlab/src",
    "<workspace_dir>/instinct_rl"
  ]
}
```

## Task Suite

Use the CLI to inspect the full list at any time:

```bash
instinct-list-envs
instinct-list-envs shadowing
```

## Quick Start

Train:

```bash
instinct-train Instinct-Locomotion-Flat-G1-v0
instinct-train Instinct-Perceptive-Shadowing-G1-v0
```

Play (`--load-run` is required):

```bash
instinct-play Instinct-Locomotion-Flat-G1-Play-v0 --load-run <run_name>
instinct-play Instinct-Perceptive-Shadowing-G1-Play-v0 --load-run <run_name>
```

Play perceptive shadowing with released weights:

```bash
instinct-play Instinct-Perceptive-Shadowing-G1-Play-v0 \
  --load-run <downloaded_run_dir> \
  --checkpoint-file <checkpoint_file>
```

Pretrained weights:

- Google Drive: [Pretrained weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RPjbZjurknhlvlj9dxAUkARkcEyexQvF?usp=sharing)

Export ONNX for parkour:

```bash
instinct-play Instinct-Parkour-Target-Amp-G1-Play-v0 --load-run <run_name> --export-onnx
```

Play parkour with released weights:

```bash
instinct-play Instinct-Parkour-Target-Amp-G1-Play-v0 \
  --load-run <downloaded_run_dir> \
  --checkpoint-file <checkpoint_file>
```

Parkour pretrained weights:

- Google Drive: [Parkour pretrained weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B2AP5MEC5hDF7w5ws9oIiRKStL_gRxhE?usp=drive_link)

Before training or playing parkour tasks, update the local dataset root in
`src/instinct_mj/tasks/parkour/config/g1/g1_parkour_target_amp_cfg.py`:

```python
_PARKOUR_DATASET_DIR = os.path.expanduser("~/your/path/to/parkour_motion_reference")
```

If your filtered motion list is stored elsewhere, also update
`filtered_motion_selection_filepath` in the same file. See
`src/instinct_mj/tasks/parkour/README.md` for the task-specific notes.

Module form is also available when console scripts are not on `PATH`:

```bash
python -m instinct_mj.scripts.instinct_rl.train Instinct-Locomotion-Flat-G1-v0
python -m instinct_mj.scripts.instinct_rl.play Instinct-Locomotion-Flat-G1-Play-v0 --load-run <run_name>
python -m instinct_mj.scripts.list_envs
```

## Code Formatting

We use `pre-commit` for formatting and hygiene checks.

Install `pre-commit`:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

Run all checks:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Or use the local helper command:

```bash
instinct-format
```

To enable hooks on every commit:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Train Your Own Projects

To preserve your own experiments and logs, it is usually better to create your own task package or repository and reuse the task patterns from `InstinctMJ`.

If you want to add a new task directly in this repository:

- Create a new folder under `src/instinct_mj/tasks/<your_project>/`.
- Add `__init__.py` at each package level.
- Register tasks with `register_instinct_task()`.
- Keep the environment config and `instinct_rl` config colocated in the task package.

Example registration pattern:

```python
from instinct_mj.tasks.registry import register_instinct_task

from .my_env_cfg import MyEnvCfg, MyEnvCfg_PLAY
from .rl_cfgs import my_instinct_rl_cfg

register_instinct_task(
    task_id="Instinct-My-Task-v0",
    env_cfg_factory=MyEnvCfg,
    play_env_cfg_factory=MyEnvCfg_PLAY,
    instinct_rl_cfg_factory=my_instinct_rl_cfg,
)
```
